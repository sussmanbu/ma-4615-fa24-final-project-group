I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

In January 2019, admissions were 2716 and releases were 3476, showing a slightly higher rate of releases than admissions. This pattern, where releases slightly exceeded admissions, persisted throughout 2019. For instance, in November 2019, admissions were 2592 and releases were 3050, and in December 2019, admissions were 2705 while releases were 3260. This steady pattern allowed for a slow reduction in the prison population over the year.\nA major shift began in early 2020 as COVID-19 spread, leading to drastic changes in both admissions and releases. In March 2020, admissions were 2272, and releases were 3117, but in April 2020, admissions dropped sharply to 9 while releases surged to 4629. This large discrepancy of 4620 between releases and admissions marked a significant departure from previous trends, suggesting a possible policy response aimed at reducing prison populations to mitigate health risks. This trend continued in the following months, as seen in July 2020, when admissions remained exceptionally low at 9, while releases peaked at an extraordinary 7522, the highest monthly release count observed in the entire period. This drastic imbalance, where releases outpaced admissions by 7513, underscores the impact of policies that prioritized reducing prison populations.\nThroughout 2020, releases consistently exceeded admissions by substantial margins. For example, in August 2020, admissions were only 105, while releases reached 4682, resulting in a difference of 4577. In September 2020, admissions were 538 compared to 3604 releases, maintaining the trend of significant population reductions. Even by December 2020, this release-focused approach persisted, with admissions at just 10 against 1995 releases.\nBy 2021, the data indicates a gradual return toward more balanced admissions and releases, though not yet at pre-pandemic levels. For instance, in January 2021, admissions were 593 while releases were 1820, showing a significant gap, though less drastic than in 2020. Over the months, admissions steadily increased. In July 2021, admissions rose to 2961, nearly matching the 2459 releases, and by December 2021, the gap had further narrowed, with admissions at 2904 and releases at 2640, signaling a shift closer to pre-COVID patterns.\nThese trends reveal three clear phases: a relatively stable admissions-releases balance in 2019, a drastic release-focused reduction in 2020, with releases exceeding 7000 in July, and a steady adjustment back to prior patterns in 2021. This progression suggests that California’s prison system adjusted its policies in response to the pandemic, initially prioritizing population reduction and then gradually returning to typical operations as conditions improved. The data demonstrates how admissions rose steadily through late 2021, approaching a balance closer to pre-pandemic patterns, reflecting a potential shift back to typical operations in the prison system."

    "section": "Comparative Analysis of California Prison Admissions and Releases Using New Data",
    "text": "Comparative Analysis of California Prison Admissions and Releases Using New Data\nThat was the analysis based on our original dataset, selected as the foundation of our study from day one. Our group has since identified a complementary California-specific dataset from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, available at https://data.ca.gov/dataset/monthly-admissions-and-releases. This new California dataset, titled “California’s Monthly Admissions and Releases,” provides monthly records of the number of individuals admitted to and released from California’s CDCR custody from January 31, 2014, to the present.\nIn response to our project’s objective, which suggests looking for a related dataset to enable a comparative analysis of California’s prison system, we aim to validate and compare results from our initial dataset with this new California source. By doing so, we can assess any discrepancies or confirm our findings regarding the trends in California prison admissions and releases, especially during the COVID-19 period.\nFor this comparison, we will focus exclusively on three critical years (2019, 2020, and 2021) to highlight COVID-19’s impact on California’s prison population dynamics. The new California-specific dataset includes the following columns:\n\nDate: Marks the end of each month when California prison admissions and releases were recorded.\nTotalAdmissions: The total admissions for each month in California prisons.\nTotalReleases: The total releases for each month from California prisons.\n\nThe following analysis and plot using the new California dataset will enable us to explore possible discrepancies and validate our conclusions drawn from the original data about California’s prison system.\n\nca_monthly_admissions_releases &lt;- read.csv(\"dataset/monthlyreleases2014-20241031.csv\")\nca_monthly_admissions_releases$Date &lt;- as.Date(ca_monthly_admissions_releases$Date, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n\ndata_filtered &lt;- ca_monthly_admissions_releases %&gt;%\n  filter(Date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & Date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-31\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Admissions = sum(TotalAdmissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Total_Releases = sum(TotalReleases, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = Date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Admissions, color = \"Total Admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Releases, color = \"Total Releases\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Prison Admissions and Releases in California (2019-2022)\",\n    subtitle = \"Based on Alternative Dataset\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Total Admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Total Releases\" = \"red\"),\n    name = NULL) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\")) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",  \n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of California’s prison admissions and releases from January 2019 to January 2022 reveals some small discrepancies between the two datasets. These differences may stem from the fact that the data originated from different sources, each likely employing slightly varied methods for data collection, rounding, or classification. Despite overall similar trends, the monthly totals sometimes vary, particularly during key periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\n2019: Minor Monthly Variations\nIn 2019, both datasets consistently show that releases exceeded admissions, suggesting a gradual reduction in the prison population across California. However, some monthly figures vary slightly. For instance, in November 2019, the original dataset records 2592 admissions and 3050 releases, while the new dataset reports 2590 admissions and 3024 releases. Similarly, in December 2019, our original dataset shows 2705 admissions and 3260 releases, whereas the new dataset lists 2702 admissions and 3253 releases. These small differences, although unlikely to impact overall trends significantly, suggest subtle differences in reporting or rounding conventions between the two sources.\n\n\n2020: Noticeable Differences During COVID-19 Impact\nThe most significant discrepancies appear during 2020, a year marked by drastic policy changes in response to COVID-19. Both datasets reflect a steep decline in admissions and a surge in releases as California likely implemented measures to reduce prison populations. However, the specifics differ. For example, in April 2020, our original dataset records 9 admissions and 4629 releases, while the new dataset shows only 2 admissions with 4627 releases.\nA similar pattern is observed in July 2020, a peak period for releases: the original dataset lists 9 admissions and 7522 releases, whereas the new dataset shows 3 admissions and 7520 releases. Although these variations are minor, they indicate that each dataset has slightly different figures, potentially due to differences in data classification or inclusion criteria. Additionally, both datasets capture the high release counts around mid-2020, though the new dataset tends to show slightly lower total releases for certain months.\n\n\n2021: Differences in the Path Back to Balance\nIn 2021, as admissions and releases began to move toward a balance, the datasets remain aligned in terms of general trends but continue to differ in specific numbers. In January 2021, for instance, our original dataset shows 593 admissions and 1820 releases, while the new dataset records 409 admissions and 1817 releases. As the year progresses, both datasets display more consistency. By July 2021, the numbers are nearly identical, with both datasets showing 2961 admissions, although our original dataset reports 2459 releases, while the new dataset lists 2457. By December 2021, the two datasets converge closely, with both listing around 2904 admissions and 2637-2640 releases, signaling a return to pre-COVID patterns.\n\n\nSummary of Dataset Comparisons\nOverall, both datasets depict three distinct phases in California’s prison admissions and releases: a stable 2019, a drastic adjustment period in 2020 due to COVID-19, and a gradual return to balance in 2021. Minor discrepancies, particularly in 2020, suggest variations in data reporting practices between the sources, which may influence specific monthly totals. Despite these differences, the datasets align well in illustrating the broader trends, reinforcing the understanding of California’s response to the pandemic within its prison system.\n\ndata$date &lt;- as.Date(data$Date)\ndata_filtered_MA_1 = data %&gt;%\n  filter(State == \"Massachusetts\") %&gt;%\n  filter(date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Admissions = sum(Total_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Total_Releases = sum(Total_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n \n# Plot for Massachusetts data\nggplot(data_filtered_MA_1, aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Admissions, color = \"Total Admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Releases, color = \"Total Releases\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Prison Admissions and Releases in Massachusetts (2019-2022)\",\n    subtitle = \"Based on Original Dataset\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Total Admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Total Releases\" = \"red\"),\n    name = NULL\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\")\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",  \n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"      \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot based on our original dataset shows the trend of total prison admissions and releases in Massachusetts from 2019 to 2021. In 2019, both admissions and releases remained relatively high, with fluctuations throughout the year. For instance, admissions peaked in June 2019 with around 650, while releases were highest in October 2019, reaching approximately 750. However, starting in early 2020, admissions dropped sharply due to the pandemic, reaching as low as 96 in April 2020. Releases also declined but not as drastically, and they continued to exceed admissions throughout much of 2020. By mid-2020, admissions began to rise again but remained well below pre-pandemic levels. In 2021, both admissions and releases stabilized, with releases generally staying higher than admissions.\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata_MA &lt;- read_excel(\"dataset/Admission_and_Release_Trends.xlsx\", sheet = \"Admission_and_Release_Trends\")\n\n# Filter and transform the data for Massachusetts (if applicable)\ndata_filtered_MA &lt;- data_MA %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(Year, Month, \"1\", sep = \"-\"), format = \"%Y-%B-%d\")) %&gt;%\n  filter(Agency == \"MA Department of Correction\") %&gt;%\n  filter(date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date, Event) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total_Count = sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = Event, values_from = Total_Count, values_fill = 0)\n\n# Plot the data\nggplot(data_filtered_MA, aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Admission, color = \"Total Admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Release, color = \"Total Releases\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Prison Admissions and Releases in Massachusetts (2019-2022)\",\n    subtitle = \"Based on Alternative Dataset\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Total Admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Total Releases\" = \"red\"),\n    name = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\")\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",\n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparative analysis of Massachusetts prison admissions and releases, we found a complementary dataset from the Massachusetts Government website, available at https://www.mass.gov/info-details/cross-tracking-system-state-county-correctional-populations. The dataset below “Downloads” section, titled “Admission_and_Release_Trends,” provides monthly records of the number of individuals admitted to and released from January 31, 2017, to the present.\nThe new dataset provides a similar timeline for Massachusetts admissions and releases but shows different numerical patterns and monthly peaks, reflecting possible differences in data sources or categorization methods. In 2019, admissions and releases also fluctuate, though the peak values are lower than those in the old dataset. For example, admissions reach a maximum of around 419 in June, significantly lower than the old dataset’s peak. In early 2020, both admissions and releases drop sharply, with admissions reaching a low of 23 in April—again lower than the old data. Unlike the old dataset, the new data suggests that releases do not stay consistently higher than admissions in late 2020; instead, they are closer in count. By 2021, both admissions and releases show a stabilized trend similar to the old dataset, although at a generally lower level.\nIn summary, while both datasets show similar patterns of decline and stabilization through the pandemic, the new dataset records consistently lower counts for admissions and releases compared to the old one.\n\ndf = read.csv(\"dataset/Race_California.csv\")\ndf_2019 &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(Year == 2019)\n \nggplot(df_2019, aes(x = Race, y = Population / 1e6)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Racial Demographics in California in 2019\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Population (in millions)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_2020 &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(Year == 2020)\n \nggplot(df_2020, aes(x = Race, y = Population / 1e6)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Racial Demographics in California in 2020\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Population (in millions)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_2021 &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(Year == 2021)\n \nggplot(df_2021, aes(x = Race, y = Population / 1e6)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Racial Demographics in California in 2021\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Population (in millions)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the bar plot, we displayed the racial demographic population in California for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. This data was gathered from the USA FACTS website, which uses racial and ethnic population data from the US Census Bureau (https://usafacts.org/data/topics/people-society/population-and-demographics/our-changing-population/state/california/?endDate=2020-01-01&startDate=2019-01-01). During these years, the race categories remained relatively consistent in population numbers: Hispanic/Latino had the highest population, followed by White, Black, Multiracial, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. Moving forward, based on the dataset we are working with, we plan to categorize ‘Multiracial’ and ‘Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander’ as ‘Other’ to align with the race categories we already use. With this race demographic data, we aim to combine it with California’s admissions/releases data and create a stacked bar plot. This will allow us to compare both sets of data and examine how the racial demographics of California compare to those in admissions and releases."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

The data loaded successfully, though some columns like race and flee have missing values that need to be cleaned for accurate analysis. We can focus on exploring racial disparities, such as whether certain racial groups are disproportionately killed by police, and how factors like threat level or body camera usage vary by race. The main challenges include handling missing data and ensuring that the analysis of racial disparities is unbiased and supported by complete data.\n\n\nDataset 2 - “WHO Suicide Statistics”\nDataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szamil/who-suicide-statistics\nRows: great quantities Columns: 6\nWe would like to analyze how suicide rates vary by race across different countries or regions. We can also analyze the trends in suicide rates over time for different racial groups to see how rates have evolved. What challenges do you foresee?\nThe dataset is not separated by race, but nationality, which would make it more difficult to address racial disparities among suicidal rates. There are limited columns, which can reduce the potential for interaction between various variables. Dealing with such a heavy subject, we would not want to oversimplify the complex phenomena. It doesn’t have any insight about the suicide risk factors, which we would be eager to analyze.\n\n\nDataset 3 - “New York City Leading Causes of Death”\nDataset Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/new-york-city-leading-causes-of-death/resource/845a3736-6ce4-46da-a82d-8a5f9add81f1\nNew York City’s health data is represented in a dataset showing the leading causes of death by sex and ethnicity since 2007. This resource, created from NYC death certificates, provides information on mortality trends with 2103 observations across several important variables. The data includes year, leading cause, sex, race, death count, and death rates, allowing for analysis of public health patterns in New York City. This dataset offers a chance to study important health trends, but it has limitations. The small number of columns may restrict the depth of analysis possible, and dealing with empty fields is another limitation to consider. Despite these issues, the data provides useful information about how different demographic groups are affected by various health problems over time. By studying this data, we aim to find patterns in death rates across different populations and identify potential areas where public health efforts could be focused."

    "text": "We are continuing to closely examine the admissions and releases dataset. The article highlights significant differences in admission and release patterns across racial groups and states, especially during the pandemic. It found that, although overall prison admissions decreased, Black and Latino populations were affected more by admissions and slower release rates than white populations. While some data from before the pandemic (pre-2019) is included, we chose to focus on data from 2019 to 2022. We also noticed that data is available for only some states, limiting our view of the whole U.S., so we plan to focus on a few specific states. The article explains that this is because states had different policies for releases and for reporting (such as self-reporting versus staff assignments).\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\n\ndata = readRDS(\"dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds\")\nhead(data)\n\n        Date Total_Admissions White_Admissions Black_Admissions\n1 2015-02-01             1583              600              193\n2 2015-03-01             1580              615              189\n3 2015-04-01             1779              706              235\n4 2015-05-01             1821              730              260\n5 2015-06-01             1689              704              215\n6 2015-07-01             1871              758              223\n  Hispanic_Admissions AmericanIndian_Admissions Asian_Admissions\n1                 633                       130                6\n2                 640                       114                3\n3                 701                       115                4\n4                 669                       125                8\n5                 618                       129                0\n6                 738                       121                5\n  Other_Admissions Total_Releases White_Releases Black_Releases\n1               21           1649            653            194\n2               19           1559            644            169\n3               18           1693            703            206\n4               29           1659            685            193\n5               23           1570            651            174\n6               26           1718            673            224\n  Hispanic_Releases AmericanIndian_Releases Asian_Releases Other_Releases\n1               688                      85              7             22\n2               610                     111              6             19\n3               657                      93              5             29\n4               616                     136              3             26\n5               603                     111              7             24\n6               662                     132              5             22\n    State\n1 Arizona\n2 Arizona\n3 Arizona\n4 Arizona\n5 Arizona\n6 Arizona\n\n\n\ndata$date &lt;- as.Date(data$Date)\ndata_filtered = data %&gt;%\n  filter(date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Admissions = sum(Total_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Total_Releases = sum(Total_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Admissions, color = \"Total Admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Total_Releases, color = \"Total Releases\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Prison Admissions and Releases for 18 States (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Total Admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Total Releases\" = \"red\"),\n    name = NULL \n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\") \n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",  \n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"      \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot titled “Total Prison Admissions and Releases for 18 States (2019-2022)” provides insights into the trends of total prison admissions and releases during this period, with the blue line representing admissions and the red line indicating releases.\nThe data captures patterns before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, there is a significant decline in admissions from February to April 2020, with counts dropping from 17500 to just below 5000, coinciding with the early rise of the pandemic. Additionally, two spikes in releases are observed: one in April 2020, possibly related to prison population management, and another in July 2020.\nThe subsequent rise in admissions during September 2020, followed by a decline until November, suggests evolving responses within the correctional system.\nWhile this analysis highlights distinct patterns, it is essential to consider potential factors behind these trends. For instance, the lockdown may have contributed to reduced crime rates due to fewer people being outside, leading to fewer arrests. Additionally, individuals with minor offenses might have been released earlier to manage the pandemic’s impact on prison populations. However, these interpretations are hypotheses that require further investigation and reading to confirm their validity.\nThis analysis underscores the complexity of interpreting shifts in prison data during unprecedented events like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\ndata_filtered &lt;- data |&gt; \n  filter(Date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & Date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) |&gt; \n  group_by(date) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    White_Admissions = sum(White_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    White_Releases = sum(White_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n \ndata_filtered |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = White_Admissions, color = \"White admissions\"), linewidth = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = White_Releases, color = \"White releases\"), linewidth = 0.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"White admissions\" = \"blue\", \"White releases\" = \"red\")) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",\n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total White Admissions and Releases for 18 States (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"White Admissions and Releases\",\n    color = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\") \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the white population plot, there is a steady trend in admissions and releases. Until March 2020, there is a spike in releases while there is a decrease in admissions. Then, as the admission slowly increases and the releases decrease, there occurs a small spike and decrease again in releases and admissions. Towards November 2020 and onwards, the relationship between admissions and releases start to regulate but not in the same numbers as in 2019.\n\ndata_filtered &lt;- data |&gt; \n  filter(Date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & Date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) |&gt; \n  group_by(date) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    AmericanIndian_Admissions = sum(AmericanIndian_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    AmericanIndian_Releases = sum(AmericanIndian_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n \ndata_filtered |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = AmericanIndian_Admissions, color = \"American-Indian admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = AmericanIndian_Releases, color = \"American-Indian releases\"), size = 0.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"American-Indian admissions\" = \"blue\", \"American-Indian releases\" = \"red\")) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",\n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total American-Indian Admissions and Releases for 18 States (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"American-Indian Admissions and Releases\",\n    color = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\") \n  )\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph illustrates trends in American-Indian admissions and releases from 2019 to 2022. Before covid period the admissions and releases were fluctuation in the range of 400 and 325 count. In the early part of 2019, admissions and releases were close in number, with some fluctuations. Around March 2020, there is a sharp drop in admissions (from 350 to 175) and a spike in releases (from 350 to 430). Admissions remain lower than releases for most of the period after March 2020, despite some fluctuations. The trend for both admissions and releases appears more volatile from 2021 onward, with admissions and releases converging and diverging frequently. By the end of the chart, both admissions and releases have decreased from their initial 2019 levels, with both metrics reaching similar levels but remaining relatively low.\n\ndata$date &lt;- as.Date(data$Date)\ndata_aggregated &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_black_admissions = sum(Black_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_black_releases = sum(Black_Releases, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\n\ndata_filtered &lt;- data_aggregated %&gt;%\n  filter(date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-31\"))\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = total_black_admissions, color = \"Black Admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = total_black_releases, color = \"Black Releases\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Black Admissions and Releases For 18 States (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Total Black Admissions and Releases\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"4 months\", date_labels = \"%b %Y\") +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Black Admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Black Releases\" = \"red\"),\n    name = NULL  \n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\") \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph illustrates trends in Black admissions and releases from 2019 to 2022. Both lines display relative stability in early 2019; however, admissions experience a sharp decline around March 2020, likely due to COVID-19 disruptions. Admissions decreased to around 500 by April 2020, while releases exhibit more fluctuations. Notably, there are two spikes in releases: one in April 2020, possibly related to efforts to manage prison populations during the pandemic, and another in July 2020. Admissions show some recovery, reaching around 3500 by late 2020, but remain significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels\n\ndata_filtered = data %&gt;%\n  filter(date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Hispanic_Admissions = sum(Hispanic_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Hispanic_Releases = sum(Hispanic_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Hispanic_Admissions, color = \"Hispanic Admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Hispanic_Releases, color = \"Hispanic Releases\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Hispanic Prison Admissions and Releases for 18 States (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Hispanic Admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Hispanic Releases\" = \"red\"),\n    name = NULL  # Remove the legend label\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\") \n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",  \n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"      \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph illustrates trends in Hispanic admissions and releases from 2019 to 2022. Prior to 2020, both admissions and releases have a relatively steady trend, with releases slightly higher than admissions at times. Around March 2020 (the start of the COVID-19 pandemic), there’s a sharp drop in admissions (from approximately 4200 to less than 1000). There are two spikes in releases shortly after, possibly as a response to the pandemic. After the initial pandemic impact, both admissions and releases fluctuate, but the admissions remain lower than pre-2020 levels. Releases eventually stabilize around mid-2021 but continue to hover close to the admission rates.\n\ndata_filtered = data %&gt;%\n  filter(date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Asian_Admissions = sum(Asian_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Asian_Releases = sum(Asian_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nggplot(data_filtered, aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Asian_Admissions, color = \"Asian Admissions\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Asian_Releases, color = \"Asian Releases\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Asian Prison Admissions and Releases for 18 States (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Asian Admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Asian Releases\" = \"red\"),\n    name = NULL  # Remove the legend label\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),  \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12), \n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\") \n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",  \n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"      \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph illustrates trends in Asian admissions and releases from 2019 to 2022. This plot shows consistently low and stable numbers from 2019 to 2022, with values generally under 100, which is significantly smaller than other racial groups. The trend remains relatively flat throughout 2019, but there’s a noticeable drop of admissions and a rise of releases slightly passed 100 around early 2020. Following this decline, admissions and releases gradually return to previous levels, hovering around 50 to 70 for most of 2021. The y-axis, capped just above 100, highlights the low representation of the Asian population in prison admissions and releases, suggesting minimal impact on the overall trend compared to other groups.\n\ndata_filtered &lt;- data |&gt; \n  filter(Date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\") & Date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\")) |&gt; \n  group_by(date) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Other_Admissions = sum(Other_Admissions, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Other_Releases = sum(Other_Releases, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n \ndata_filtered |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Other_Admissions, color = \"Other admissions\"), size = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Other_Releases, color = \"Other releases\"), size = 0.5) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Other admissions\" = \"blue\", \"Other releases\" = \"red\")) +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"4 months\",\n    date_labels = \"%b %Y\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Other Admissions and Releases for 18 States (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Other Admissions and Releases\",\n    color = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11.2),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.key.size = unit(1.2, \"cm\") \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph illustrates trends in admissions and releases of other races from 2019 to 2022. Notably, in the pre-COVID period, there is a significant spike in releases from September to November, increasing from 250 to 2000 in just one month and then dropping back to 250. This spike is unrelated to COVID-19. During the COVID-19 period, admissions show a minor decline from February 2020, decreasing from 250 to 100, then rising again. Releases also exhibit a small spike in July 2020. After March 2021, both lines move closer to each other, though they remain slightly lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nMoving forward, we will narrow our analysis to focus on specific states, examining how admissions and releases have varied across racial groups. This targeted approach will help us better understand the differences in trends during the pandemic. By comparing these patterns, we aim to uncover more nuanced insights into racial disparities within the prison system."

    "text": "In response to our first blog post, we shifted our focus to analyzing the US prison population. This dataset includes information on admission and release totals, along with the total broken down by race, the date of this data collection, and the states from which the data was gathered. The data comes from the article titled “COVID-19 Amplified Racial Disparities in the US Criminal Legal System,” collected by a team of researchers. This data was collected to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the racial composition of US prisons. Despite an overall decrease in the prison population, the proportion of incarcerated Black and Latino prisoners increased. So, the study aims to understand why this happened and how the pandemic made racial inequalities in the prison system worse. The data is available on Nature.com, a scientific journal that publishes peer-reviewed research and news.\n\n\nWe firstly found the dataset on Kaggle. There is a link to github(https://github.com/jkbren/incarcerated-populations-data/), which is also the original source of this dataset.

This ensures we can visualize the total counts of admissions and releases for different racial groups over the entire time range.\n\nadmissions_melt = tidyr::gather(admissions_totals, key = \"Race\", value = \"Admissions\")\nreleases_melt = tidyr::gather(releases_totals, key = \"Race\", value = \"Releases\")\n\n\nadmissions_melt$Race = c(\"White\", \"Black\", \"Hispanic\", \"American Indian\", \"Asian\", \"Other\")\nreleases_melt$Race = c(\"White\", \"Black\", \"Hispanic\", \"American Indian\", \"Asian\", \"Other\")\n\n\n\nHere, we reshaped the summarized data using tidyr::gather() to convert it into a long format, which is suitable for plotting with ggplot2. Additionally, we ensured the race names were labeled correctly for clear and consistent x-axis labels in the plots.\n\nggplot(admissions_melt, aes(x = reorder(Race, -Admissions), y = Admissions, fill = Race)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Total Prison Admissions by Race for the Entire Time Range\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Total Admissions\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10))\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"White\" = \"#1f77b4\",    \n    \"Black\" = \"#ff7f0e\",    \n    \"Hispanic\" = \"#2ca02c\", \n    \"American Indian\" = \"#d62728\", \n    \"Asian\" = \"#9467bd\",    \n    \"Other\" = \"#8c564b\"   \n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, we visualized the total prison admissions by race across the entire time range from January 1, 2000 to September 1, 2022. Each bar represents a different racial group, and we used custom colors for the bars to distinguish them. The bars are sorted in descending order based on the total admissions for each race. The bar plot for total prison admissions by race shows that White individuals account for the highest number of admissions (865,467), followed by Black individuals (368,346), and Hispanic individuals (277,007). American Indian admissions (36,958) are notably lower, and Asian (7,396) and Other (18,627) groups represent the smallest proportions. These disparities highlight racial differences in prison admissions, and future analyses will explore how these patterns change over time, particularly focusing on significant periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nggplot(releases_melt, aes(x = reorder(Race, -Releases), y = Releases, fill = Race)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Total Prison Releases by Race for the Entire Time Range\", x = \"Race\", y = \"Total Releases\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10))\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"White\" = \"#1f77b4\",  \n    \"Black\" = \"#ff7f0e\",  \n    \"Hispanic\" = \"#2ca02c\", \n    \"American Indian\" = \"#d62728\",\n    \"Asian\" = \"#9467bd\",  \n    \"Other\" = \"#8c564b\" \n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, this plot shows the total prison releases by race for the entire time range from January 1, 2000 to September 1, 2022. Like the admissions plot, the bars are color-coded and sorted in descending order of total releases, giving a clear overview of the distribution of releases among different racial groups. The bar plot for total prison releases shows similar trends, with White individuals having the highest release count (899298), followed by Black (407339) and Hispanic (307995) individuals. Again, American Indian (37153), Asian (7540), and Other (22,563) groups have smaller totals. Moving forward, we will conduct a time-dependent analysis to examine trends over various time periods, with special attention to the effects of COVID-19 on prison admissions and releases during the pandemic.\n\n\nTransparency and representation are key principles in equitable data practices, both of which are relevant to our analysis of the prison admissions and releases dataset. We will ensure transparency by clearly documenting the data source, collection methods, and any potential limitations, such as missing data or sample bias, to prevent misuse or misinterpretation. Additionally, we will focus on representation by checking the distribution of different racial groups in the dataset to ensure no group is underrepresented, and we will acknowledge any imbalances that may affect our results. This approach helps promote fairness and accuracy in our analysis."

    "text": "For Blog Post 4, we are focusing on analyzing data from specific states, starting with California. We chose California because it has one of the largest populations in the country, which means there’s more data available on its population demographic. This helps ensure that our analysis is reliable and detailed.\nWe’re concentrating on the 2019 to 2022 years, which cover the main covid period, so we can explore how the pandemic may have impacted these rates. Our goal is to gather data on California’s racial demographics to compare admission and release rates both by race and across the total population.\nIn our model, we aim to predict total prison admissions by analyzing how admissions from different racial groups contribute to overall numbers. By examining the impact of admissions from each racial group, we can identify which groups contribute the most to the total number of admissions. This model enables us to make predictions about future admissions, understand how various groups influence the overall numbers, and observe how trends may change over time, particularly in response to policy changes or significant events like the pandemic. Through this approach, we aim to uncover important patterns and disparities in prison admissions.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(pls)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'pls'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    loadings\n\nlibrary(car)\n\nLoading required package: carData\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'car'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    recode\n\n\n\ndata = readRDS(\"dataset/cleaned_dataset.rds\")\ndata$date = as.Date(data$Date)\n\ndata_filtered = data %&gt;%\n  filter(State == \"California\", date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\"), date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\"))\n\ndata_long = data_filtered %&gt;%\n  select(date, White_Admissions, Black_Admissions, Hispanic_Admissions, AmericanIndian_Admissions, Asian_Admissions, Other_Admissions) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -date, names_to = \"Race\", values_to = \"Admissions\")\n\nggplot(data_long, aes(x = date, y = Admissions, color = Race)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Prison Admissions in California by Race (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Admissions\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"White_Admissions\" = \"blue\",\n      \"Black_Admissions\" = \"red\",\n      \"Hispanic_Admissions\" = \"green\",\n      \"AmericanIndian_Admissions\" = \"orange\",\n      \"Asian_Admissions\" = \"purple\",\n      \"Other_Admissions\" = \"brown\")) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Hispanic admission Black admissions peaked at around 1500 in early 2020 but showed a sharp decline later that year, reflecting pandemic-related changes in law enforcement and public health policies. White admissions approached 1000 at the end of 2021, indicating fluctuations similar to Black admissions. Meanwhile, Hispanic and Asian groups consistently recorded lower admissions, generally remaining below 500, suggesting lesser representation or varying enforcement practices. Overall, these trends highlight the need for targeted interventions to address systemic disparities in the prison system. Our dataset is kind of missing Asian and American Indian data. Asian admission is 0 for this whole period and American Indian admission is 1 in May 2020, which is not realistic. Therefore, we will focus on the admission patterns for Hispanic, Black, White, and Other races. In 2019, Hispanic admissions remained high, fluctuating between 1250 and 1500, while both White and Black admissions stabilized around 700, with White peaking of 1400 in March. In 2020, all races experienced a dramatic drop in admissions to zero due to COVID-19. However, starting in June 2020, admissions for each race rebounded to about half of their previous levels. By 2021, admissions returned to their pre-COVID patterns: Hispanic remained around 1300, Black and White climbed back to approximately 750, experiencing fluctuations, while admissions for Other stabilized at around 250.\n\ndata_filtered &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(State == \"California\", date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\"), date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\"))\ndata_long &lt;- data_filtered |&gt;\n  select(date, White_Releases, Black_Releases, Hispanic_Releases, AmericanIndian_Releases, Asian_Releases, Other_Releases) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -date, names_to = \"Race\", values_to = \"Releases\")\n\nggplot(data_long, aes(x = date, y = Releases, color = Race)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = .5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Prison Releases in California by Race (2019-2022)\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Releases\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"White_Releases\" = \"blue\",\n      \"Black_Releases\" = \"red\",\n      \"Hispanic_Releases\" = \"green\",\n      \"AmericanIndian_Releases\" = \"orange\",\n      \"Asian_Releases\" = \"purple\",\n      \"Other_Releases\" = \"brown\")) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 13),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the number of total prison releases in California by race from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2021. It illustrates a notable disparity in prison release numbers by race, with the Hispanic group showing the highest release numbers, followed by White and Black groups with a similar trend. The Other category also has minor fluctuations, while American Indian and Asian groups have a minimal number of releases over the period.\nHispanic releases consistently show the highest numbers among all racial categories throughout the pandemic period. This group experiences two major spikes, with the highest peak in mid-2020, reaching more than 3000 releases. After this peak, there is a steep decline, followed by a more moderate trend with minor fluctuations through 2021. As mentioned earlier, Black and White releases exhibit similar patterns. Both groups show two noticeable increases in early 2020, with less pronounced peaks compared to the Hispanic group. Just like the Hispanic group, Black and White groups display a flatter pattern from late 2020 throughout the whole of 2021.\nOther group is a relatively small group, but shows one major peak in late 2019, preceding all the other racial groups. This spike appears more pronounced due to this category’s low baseline of releases. After the peak, releases stabilize at a lower level and maintain a steady trend through 2020 and 2021.\nThe fact that American Indian and Asian prison release numbers are consistently reported as zero throughout the period is an unrealistic phenomenon. In any large and diverse prison system, such as California’s, it would be expected that at least some individuals from every racial group would be released over a multi-year period. This consistent zero likely reflects issues with data reporting or categorization rather than a true absence of releases, as it is improbable for entire racial groups to have no recorded releases for several years.\nThe significant peaks in prison releases for most racial groups (Hispanic, Black, and White) around early to mid-2020 likely correspond to policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, many jurisdictions, including California, implemented emergency measures to reduce prison populations to mitigate the spread of the virus within the facilities. These measures included early releases, prioritizing individuals nearing the end of their sentences, and releasing those deemed low-risk or vulnerable to severe COVID-19 complications.\nNow lets do the modelling part…\n\ndata_filtered = data %&gt;%\n  filter(date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-01\"), date &lt;= as.Date(\"2022-01-01\"))\ndata_filtered &lt;- data_filtered[complete.cases(data_filtered), ]\n\n\nmodel_matrix &lt;- model.matrix(~ White_Admissions + Black_Admissions +\n                           Hispanic_Admissions + AmericanIndian_Admissions +\n                           Asian_Admissions + Other_Admissions - 1,\n                           data = data_filtered)\npcr_model &lt;- pcr(Total_Admissions ~ model_matrix,\n                 data = data_filtered,\n                 scale = TRUE,\n                 validation = \"CV\")\n\n\nsummary_pcr &lt;- summary(pcr_model)\n\nData:   X dimension: 665 6 \n    Y dimension: 665 1\nFit method: svdpc\nNumber of components considered: 6\n\nVALIDATION: RMSEP\nCross-validated using 10 random segments.\n       (Intercept)  1 comps  2 comps  3 comps  4 comps  5 comps  6 comps\nCV            1018    253.2    187.7    80.28    54.46    54.86    39.29\nadjCV         1018    252.6    187.5    80.12    54.36    54.75    39.21\n\nTRAINING: % variance explained\n                  1 comps  2 comps  3 comps  4 comps  5 comps  6 comps\nX                   50.36    73.29    86.55    95.67    98.70   100.00\nTotal_Admissions    93.99    96.70    99.40    99.72    99.72    99.86\n\nprint(\"Number of components:\")\n\n[1] \"Number of components:\"\n\nprint(pcr_model$ncomp)\n\n[1] 6\n\nncomp_optimal &lt;- which.min(RMSEP(pcr_model)$val[1,,])-1\nprint(paste(\"Optimal number of components:\", ncomp_optimal))\n\n[1] \"Optimal number of components: 6\"\n\n\nWe performed Principal Component Regression analysis on prison admission data from 2019-2022, utilizing 665 observations and 6 racial/ethnic admission predictors. The model was validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The component structure reveals that the first component explains 50.36% of predictor variance, with two components capturing 73.29%, and all six components explaining 100%.\nThe model’s performance, measured by cross-validated RMSEP, shows substantial error reduction from the baseline 1018 to 38.94 with all six components. Notably, the model exhibits strong predictive power, with the first component alone explaining 93.99% of variance in total admissions, and three components reaching 99.40%. The optimal model uses all 6 components, though the high explained variance with fewer components suggests a more parsimonious model might be practical.\n\nfinal_pcr &lt;- pcr(Total_Admissions ~ model_matrix,\n                 data = data_filtered,\n                 scale = TRUE,\n                 ncomp = ncomp_optimal)\ncoef_pcr &lt;- coef(final_pcr, ncomp = ncomp_optimal, intercept = TRUE)\nprint(\"Coefficients:\")\n\n[1] \"Coefficients:\"\n\nprint(coef_pcr)\n\n, , 6 comps\n\n                          Total_Admissions\n(Intercept)                       7.789307\nWhite_Admissions                404.434900\nBlack_Admissions                283.856527\nHispanic_Admissions             396.427015\nAmericanIndian_Admissions        23.158679\nAsian_Admissions                  4.466240\nOther_Admissions                 19.771760\n\n\nThe final PCR model was fitted using all six components, as determined by the optimal number of components from cross-validation. The coefficients represent the relationship between each racial/ethnic category and total admissions. White admissions show the strongest effect (404.43), followed closely by Hispanic admissions (396.43) and Black admissions (283.86). The model indicates substantially smaller effects for American Indian (23.16), Other (19.77), and Asian admissions (4.47), with an intercept of 7.79. These coefficients represent the expected change in total admissions for a one-unit increase in each admission category, while accounting for the correlations among predictors through the PCR framework.\n\nfitted_values &lt;- predict(final_pcr, ncomp = ncomp_optimal)\nresiduals &lt;- data_filtered$Total_Admissions - fitted_values\nn &lt;- nrow(data_filtered)\np &lt;- ncol(model_matrix)\nmse &lt;- sum(residuals^2)/(n-p-1)\nX &lt;- cbind(1, model_matrix)\nstd_errors &lt;- sqrt(diag(mse * solve(t(X) %*% X)))\ncoef_vector &lt;- as.vector(coef_pcr)\nt_values &lt;- coef_vector/std_errors\np_values &lt;- 2 * (1 - pt(abs(t_values), df = n-p-1))\nr_squared &lt;- 1 - sum(residuals^2)/sum((data_filtered$Total_Admissions - mean(data_filtered$Total_Admissions))^2)\nadj_r_squared &lt;- 1 - (1-r_squared) * ((n-1)/(n-p-1))\n\nThis code segment calculates key model performance metrics. We first generate predicted values (fitted_values) and calculate residuals by subtracting these from actual total admissions. The mean squared error (mse) is computed from these residuals, accounting for degrees of freedom (n-p-1). Standard errors are derived using the design matrix X and mse. T-values are calculated by dividing coefficients by their standard errors, leading to p-values using the t-distribution. Finally, we compute R-squared (proportion of variance explained) and its adjusted version, which accounts for the number of predictors in the model.\n\nsummary_df &lt;- data.frame(\n    Variable = c(\"(Intercept)\", colnames(model_matrix)),\n    Coefficient = round(coef_vector, 4),\n    Std_Error = round(std_errors, 4),\n    t_value = round(t_values, 4),\n    p_value = format.pval(p_values, digits = 4, eps = 1e-4)\n)\ncat(\"\\nPRINCIPAL COMPONENT REGRESSION SUMMARY\\n\")\n\n\nPRINCIPAL COMPONENT REGRESSION SUMMARY\n\ncat(\"====================================\\n\")\n\n====================================\n\ncat(sprintf(\"R-squared: %.4f\\n\", r_squared))\n\nR-squared: 0.9986\n\ncat(sprintf(\"Adjusted R-squared: %.4f\\n\", adj_r_squared))\n\nAdjusted R-squared: 0.9986\n\ncat(sprintf(\"Number of components used: %d\\n\", ncomp_optimal))\n\nNumber of components used: 6\n\n\nThis section creates a comprehensive summary data frame containing all model statistics and displays key performance metrics. The extremely high R-squared and adjusted R-squared values (both 0.9986) indicate that the model explains 99.86% of the variance in total admissions, even after adjusting for the number of predictors. Using all six components achieves this nearly perfect fit, suggesting that each racial/ethnic admission category contributes meaningfully to predicting total admissions.\n\nprint(summary_df)\n\n                                           Variable Coefficient Std_Error\n                                        (Intercept)      7.7893    2.6597\nWhite_Admissions                   White_Admissions    404.4349    0.0065\nBlack_Admissions                   Black_Admissions    283.8565    0.0131\nHispanic_Admissions             Hispanic_Admissions    396.4270    0.0105\nAmericanIndian_Admissions AmericanIndian_Admissions     23.1587    0.0710\nAsian_Admissions                   Asian_Admissions      4.4662    0.3533\nOther_Admissions                   Other_Admissions     19.7718    0.0784\n                             t_value  p_value\n                              2.9286 0.003522\nWhite_Admissions          61867.5702  &lt; 1e-04\nBlack_Admissions          21745.1320  &lt; 1e-04\nHispanic_Admissions       37925.4412  &lt; 1e-04\nAmericanIndian_Admissions   326.1195  &lt; 1e-04\nAsian_Admissions             12.6404  &lt; 1e-04\nOther_Admissions            252.2904  &lt; 1e-04\n\n\nAll variables exhibit statistical significance at the highest conventional level (p &lt; 0.0001), except the intercept which is still highly significant (p = 0.003522). The intercept of 7.7893 represents baseline admissions when all racial/ethnic admissions are zero, though this has limited practical interpretation in this context. The coefficients reveal a clear hierarchy of impacts:\nWhite admissions (404.435) show the strongest relationship with total admissions, implying that each unit increase corresponds to approximately 404 more total admissions. This is followed closely by Hispanic admissions (396.427) and Black admissions (283.856), suggesting these three groups are the primary drivers of total admission numbers. Considerably smaller effects are observed for American Indian (23.159), Other (19.772), and Asian admissions (4.466).\nThe extremely high t-values (ranging from 12.64 for Asian to 61,867.6 for White admissions) and correspondingly low p-values indicate exceptional statistical reliability. The remarkably small standard errors (all &lt; 0.36) demonstrate high precision in our estimates. This precision is particularly notable for White (0.0065), Black (0.0131), and Hispanic (0.0105) admissions, suggesting our model captures these relationships with exceptional accuracy.\nThese findings suggest a highly stratified admission pattern where changes in White, Hispanic, and Black admissions have substantially larger effects on total admissions compared to other racial/ethnic groups. The model’s statistical robustness (as evidenced by the significance levels and standard errors) provides strong confidence in these observed patterns.\nThe magnitude differences between groups might reflect underlying systemic patterns in the criminal justice system, though such interpretation requires careful consideration of broader socio-economic and demographic factors not captured in this model.\n\nvif_scores &lt;- vif(lm(Total_Admissions ~ White_Admissions + Black_Admissions +\n                     Hispanic_Admissions + AmericanIndian_Admissions +\n                     Asian_Admissions + Other_Admissions,\n                     data = data_filtered))\ncat(\"\\nVARIANCE INFLATION FACTORS (Before PCR)\\n\")\n\n\nVARIANCE INFLATION FACTORS (Before PCR)\n\nprint(round(vif_scores, 4))\n\n         White_Admissions          Black_Admissions       Hispanic_Admissions \n                   3.3481                    6.2879                    7.6723 \nAmericanIndian_Admissions          Asian_Admissions          Other_Admissions \n                   1.3867                    1.2866                    2.4934 \n\nwrite.csv(summary_df, \"pcr_regression_results.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nThe Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) reveal moderate multicollinearity in the dataset. A common rule of thumb suggests that VIF values exceeding 5 or 10 indicate problematic multicollinearity. In our analysis, Hispanic admissions (7.67) and Black admissions (6.29) show concerning levels of multicollinearity, indicating their variations are moderately explained by other predictors in the model.\nWhite admissions (3.35) and Other admissions (2.49) show moderate but acceptable levels of multicollinearity, while American Indian (1.39) and Asian admissions (1.29) demonstrate very low multicollinearity. This pattern suggests that using PCR was indeed appropriate, particularly for handling the correlations among Hispanic and Black admission variables, though the overall multicollinearity isn’t as severe as might have been expected in such demographic data.\nThis VIF analysis justifies our use of PCR while also suggesting that simpler regression techniques might have been viable given the moderate levels of multicollinearity for most variables.\nOur PCR analysis effectively addressed the multicollinearity in California prison admissions data, successfully transforming correlated predictors into interpretable components. Though simpler regression techniques might be viable alternatives, given the moderate initial multicollinearity levels. Future research should extend to other states to provide comparative insights."
